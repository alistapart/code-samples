		<h1>A Case for Responsive Résumés</h1>
	</header>
	<article>
		<p>Finding a job is easy. As a job seeker, having your résumé in <code>.pdf</code> format is all you'll ever need. Creating a clean résumé in HTML5/CSS3 which scales well to different viewport sizes is a futile exercise.</p>
		<p>All lies! Tethering our résumés to <code>.pdf</code> format is outmoded. Here are four reasons why it's a great idea to author your résumé in HTML:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Static résumés become quickly outdated. A single, unified URL assures a recruiter or agency that your résumé is always up to date.</li>
			<li>A potential employer may view your résumé on a smartphone. Do you really want to trust a stiff, unresponsive <code>.pdf</code> to represent you?</li>
			<li>Editing <code>.pdf</code> files can be a painful experience.</li>
			<li>A DIY HTML résumé shows potential employers how much you love what you do, which can never hurt your chances.</li>
		</ol>
		<p>Let's look at the requirements for our <a href="demo.html">responsive résumé</a>.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>It must be easy to maintain.</li>
			<li>It must look spiffy.</li>
			<li>It must scale well to smaller devices.</li>
		</ul>
		<h2>It must be easy to maintain.</h2>
		<p>Judging the maintainability of a document comes down to this: <em>How efficiently can we locate and update various parts of the document?</em> The easiest way to achieve maintainability is to create small and clear markup. So that's exactly what we're going to do.</p>
		<p>Examining the source, you'll notice nothing shocking. After a simple <code>header</code>, we've established two columns, and each column houses various <code>article</code> elements. In just a few lines of HTML, we've completed our markup. As you probably know, small markup is key to maintainability, and we've honored that.</p>
		<h2>It must look spiffy.</h2>
		<p>Your résumé needs to look as awesome as you are, so we'll call upon the <code>CSS</code> cavalry for assistance. Using the mobile-first approach, we first define responsive rules for smaller viewports (less than 520px wide). Why did I choose 520 pixels as the media query <em>breaking point</em>? This particular design looks a bit too condensed at sizes smaller than 520px. The number is completely arbitrary and specific to your own design.</p>
		<p>A little flare isn't a bad thing, so I added a simple <code>CSS</code> transition towards the bottom of our media query which adds a nice touch in supporting browsers. Browsers not supporting transitions will harmlessly ignore our transition. Enlarge your webkit browser from small (less than 520px) to large to view the transition.</p>
		<pre>.date-ranges {
    width: 15.4639%;
    <strong>transition:all .3s ease;
    -o-transition:all .3s ease; 
    -moz-transition:all .3s ease;
    -webkit-transition:all .3s ease;</strong>    
}</pre>
		<h2>It must scale well to smaller devices.</h2>
		<p>Resize the <a href="demo.html">demo</a> and test liberally. Our design is mobile-friendly while still retaining its good looks.</p>
		<h2>Where can I use this?</h2>
		<p>If you have space on a server, you can store your résumé there, pointing a recruiter or agency to your always&ndash;current URL. <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/">Linkedin</a> users know that, at the time of this writing, no field exists in a user profile to add a résumé or CV URL. For now, we're stuck with the old meat and potatoes document upload. Sadly, this is the case on many other popular job-hunting sites as well. And that's exactly why I've written this article, to hopefully freshen the stale air we're breathing.</p>
		<p>As many grizzled job veterans know, a sharp résumé and near-flawless interview may <em>still</em> leave you short of your dream job. Competition is fierce and never wanes. But finding new ways to distinguish ourselves in today's unforgiving economy is vital to a developer's survival.</p>
