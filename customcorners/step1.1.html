<body>
<h3>Top left </h3>
<p>This is used to cover the entire top and left sides
  - and background. You could ofcourse leave the background
  transparent, and there by let anything behind it
  bleed through. </p>

<h3>Top right</h3>
<p>In our example this will be placed in the top right
  corner of an &lt;h3&gt; element, and therefore it needs
  to be as high as we expect our &lt;h3&gt; element to be. </p>
<p><img src="images/custom_corners_topright.gif" width="17" height="120" /></p>
<hr noshade />
<h3>Bottom left</h3>
<p>This will be used to cover the bottom left corner,
  and the bottom side. It therefore needs to be as
  wide as you expect your given &quot;article&quot; to be. </p>
<p><img src="images/custom_corners_bottomleft.gif" width="800" height="18" /></p>
<hr noshade />
<h3>Bottom right</h3>
<p>In our example we are placing the bottom right corner
  in a paragraph. Therefore it needs to be as high
  as you expect that paragraph to be. </p>
<p><img src="images/custom_corners_bottomright.gif" width="16" height="120" /></p>
<hr noshade />
<h3>Right border</h3>
<p>Even though it's hard to see, it's there. This is
  a 1 pixel high graphic we're repeating along the
  y-axis of the body text. </p>
