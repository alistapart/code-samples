<h2><a href="https://alistapart.com/articles/daemonskin/">Daemon Skins: Separating Presentation from Content</a></h2>



<h2>Exhuming the script (How I Skinned iBlog)</h2>

<p>This sidebar explains, step by step, the JavaScript that I use
to apply different CSS files to an HTML file. I have included the
script in its entirety at the <a href="#script"
title="Jump to the script...">end of the page</a> should you wish
to use or modify it.</p>

<p>The first part of the script came from Porter Glendinning. He
used it to strip off a named anchor so that he could jump to that
anchor after it was called within a frameset (see <a
href="http://www.serve.com/apg/workshop/framedAnchors/"
title="Linking to a Named Anchor Within a Frameset, the JavaScript that launched a thousand skins..."
>his code and explanation</a> for more details). I
modified the script to grab the name of a linked stylesheet, and
then document.write the link. Adding the name of the stylesheet to
the end of the url as a query string allows you to change
stylesheets at the click of a mouse. Within certain limitations, of
course...</p>

<p>Let's dissect the code:</p>

<p>Put the URL into the string variable parentURL:</p>

 <pre>
 parentURL = ""+document.location;
</pre> 
 

<p>Check to see if there is a query string (a "?" followed by a
string) at the end of the URL (parSharpIndex):</p>

 <pre>
 parSharpIndex = parentURL.indexOf("?");
</pre> 
 

<p>If there is anything in parSharpIndex, assign it to the variable
anchorString:</p>

 <pre>
 if (parSharpIndex &gt;= 0) {
  anchorString = parentURL.substring(parSharpIndex, parentURL.length);

</pre> 
 

<p>Here's where things get geeky. I set up a regular expression. It
looks pretty complicated, but is actually fairly simple, at least
in concept. First it looks for a question mark (?), followed by any
number of letters (these are remembered because <code>\w*</code> is in
parentheses), followed by <code>.css</code>:</p>

 <pre>
 MyRe=/\?(\w*)\.css/g;
</pre> 
 

<p>Apply the regular expression to the string anchorString, and put
the remembered string into an array. Assign the contents of the
array to the variable anchor:</p>

 <pre>
   MyArray = MyRe.exec(anchorString);
  anchor = RegExp.$1;
    }
</pre> 
 

<p>If there is no query string in the URL, assign the string
'classic' to anchor. This is the default stylesheet for the
blog:</p>

 <pre>
     else {
     anchor = 'classic';
     }

</pre> 
 

<p>Use document.write to write the linked stylesheet (anchor), and
you are done:</p>

<pre>
document.write('&lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="' + anchor + '.css"
type="text\/css"&gt;');

</pre> 
 

<h2>Applying the Code</h2>

<p>So, what does it look like in action? I've created three
different stylesheets: <a
href="http://gnuhaus.com/iblog/0011.html?classic.css"
title="The original look of iBook, iMac, iBlog..." target="ala">classic.css</a> is essentially the original stylesheet
for iBook, iMac, iBlog. The next one I created was an exorcism in
something completely opposite interms of readability, and style -
it's called <a
href="http://gnuhaus.com/iblog/0011.html?skate.css"
title="I was going for a grungy, difficult to read look here - something very different from classic.css...">skate.css</a>. The last one uses an image of a
microphone as a background and is called <a
href="http://gnuhaus.com/iblog/0011.html?mic.css"
title="If the Web is the largest public address system, then my blog is my microphone...">mic.css</a>.</p>

<p>Currently, due to the way the regular expression is set up, the
CSS file must be located in the same directory as the HTML file in
order for the script to apply it to the blog. It would be fairly
trivial to modify the regular expression to accept fully qualified
URLs, allowing anyone to create a stylesheet, put it anywhere on
the web, and then link to it by adding
"?http://www.example.com/xyz.css" to the end of the URL. Also, the
skin will only apply to a single page. To be more ubiquitous would
require setting cookies or using server side solutions. Feel free
to take the script and use it or modify it as you see fit.</p>

<h2 id="script">The Script</h2>

<pre>&lt;script language="JavaScript" type="text/javascript"&gt;
&lt;!--
parentURL = ""+document.location;
parSharpIndex = parentURL.indexOf("?");
if (parSharpIndex &gt;= 0) {
  anchorString = parentURL.substring(parSharpIndex, parentURL.length);

MyRe=/\?(\w*)\.css/g;
MyArray = MyRe.exec(anchorString);
anchor = RegExp.$1;
}
else {
 anchor = 'classic';
 }
document.write('&lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="' + anchor + '.css"
type="text\/css"&gt;');

// --&gt;
&lt;/script&gt;
</pre>
